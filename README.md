# Jumper
A hangman style game in C#
You are shown an image of a parachute and asked to guess a letter. That letter that you input is taken and sent to the compare class. It is compared to the string of letters to a word randomly chosen. If it matches one of the letters it is marked true and alters the star location string for the word. If it is wrong and marked false, it will not alter the string and will trigger a mistake counter that will send out the next image of the popping parachute.
